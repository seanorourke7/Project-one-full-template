# RJPhoptography

This site is to showcase a (fictional) photographers work and give users the chance to view a sample of his work and an ability to contact him directly.

I built it to demonstrate the abilities i have learned so far, and for course evaluation.
This is a multi page site with links to each page. It contains a Home(about), Gallery, and a Contact form with a thank you message that refreshes to the main page. 

The site is responsive across different screen sizes.

## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories

First time visitors will be greeted by a clean homepage with clear information. 

In the center there is a portrait of the photographer and a short bio with some reviews.

The header content reacts with hover to invite interaction and leads the user through the site.

The gallery is accessable through the header and also through the hyperlink in the bio.

The header, footer and background image are consistant across all pages to help with the flow.

The logo at the top of the page will also react on hover and bring the user to the home page.

The socials in the footer stand out againt the background image and are intuatively placed.

The contact form is clearly labeled and the submit button reacts on hover to encourage interaction. All fields are set to their specified content and will give feedback if wrong or missing info is entered. 

Repeat visitors will benefit from updated gallerys of recent work and updated reviews as they are published.  


## Design

### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme is based on the background image of the sea arriving on the beach. This image was used as it has a natural flow from top to bottom starting from a dark cyan and transitioning naturally to a light brown. 

It works well in this case as it helps with the natural flow of a website and the intuitive nature of where the header body and footer are located. 

All sections within the image are offset then to apear almost translucent to the background.

This allows for the use of black and white font and keeps the colour scheme simple but effective. 

### Typography

I've used Kanit font as it is buisness like while also maintaining a modern style. 

It's easy to read and looks well when used as headers and paragraphs. This means I can use it across the site and keep the flow of the site intact. 

file:///workspaces/rjphotography/assets/images/kanit%20font.jpg

### Imagery

I've used a selection of coyright free images from pexels.com. They show a range of subjects to show off the photographers skillset. Weddings, corporate events, music events and drone images.  

### Wireframes

I drew out the wireframes with pen and paper and then worked from that template into the site. 

## Features

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed user experience section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/TheQuizArms#Features)

This section can be used to explain what pages your site is made up of.

### General features on each page

If there is a feature that appears on all pages of your site, include it here. Examples of what to include would the the navigation, a footer and a favicon.

I then like to add a screenshot of each page of the site here, i use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) which allows me to grab an image of the site as it would be displayed on mobile, tablet and desktop, this helps to show the responsiveness of the site.

### Future Implementations

What features would you like to implement in the future on your site? Would you like to add more pages, or create login functionality? Add these plans here.

### Accessibility

Be an amazing developer and get used to thinking about accessibility in all of your projects!

This is the place to make a note of anything you have done with accessibility in mind. Some examples include:

Have you used icons and added aria-labels to enable screen readers to understand these?
Have you ensured your site meets the minimum contrast requirements?
Have you chosen fonts that are dyslexia/accessible friendly?

Code Institute have an amazing channel for all things accessibility (a11y-accessibility) I would highly recommend joining this channel as it contains a wealth of information about accessibility and what we can do as developers to be more inclusive.

## Technologies Used

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Technologies Used section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/Bully-Book-Club#Technologies-Used)

### Languages Used

Make a note here of all the languages used in creating your project. For the first project this will most likely just be HTML & CSS.

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

Add any frameworks, libraries or programs used while creating your project.

Make sure to include things like git, GitHub, the program used to make your wireframes, any programs used to compress your images, did you use a CSS framework like Bootstrap? If so add it here (add the version used).

A great tip for this section is to include them as you use them, that way you won't forget what you ended up using when you get to the end of your project.

## Deployment & Local Development

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Deployment & Local Development section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/TheQuizArms#Deployment)

### Deployment

Include instructions here on how to deploy your project. For your first project you will most likely be using GitHub Pages.

### Local Development

The local development section gives instructions on how someone else could make a copy of your project to play with on their local machine. This section will get more complex in the later projects, and can be a great reference to yourself if you forget how to do this.

#### How to Fork

Place instructions on how to fork your project here.

#### How to Clone

Place instructions on how to clone your project here.

## Testing

Start as you mean to go on - and get used to writing a TESTING.md file from the very first project!

Testing requirements aren't massive for your first project, however if you start using a TESTING.md file from your first project you will thank yourself later when completing your later projects, which will contain much more information.
  
Use this part of the README to link to your TESTING.md file - you can view the example TESTING.md file [here](milestone1-testing.md)

## Credits

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Credits section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/BookWorm#Credits)

The Credits section is where you can credit all the people and sources you used throughout your project.

### Code Used

If you have used some code in your project that you didn't write, this is the place to make note of it. Credit the author of the code and if possible a link to where you found the code. You could also add in a brief description of what the code does, or what you are using it for here.

### Content

Who wrote the content for the website? Was it yourself - or have you made the site for someone and they specified what the site was to say? This is the best place to put this information.

### ¬†Media

If you have used any media on your site (images, audio, video etc) you can credit them here. I like to link back to the source where I found the media, and include where on the site the image is used.
  
### ¬†Acknowledgments

If someone helped you out during your project, you can acknowledge them here! For example someone may have taken the time to help you on slack with a problem. Pop a little thank you here with a note of what they helped you with (I like to try and link back to their GitHub or Linked In account too). This is also a great place to thank your mentor and tutor support if you used them.
