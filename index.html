                        situation and I was able to enjoy my special day. I love the pictures and will treasure them

                        "We were caught on short notice and needed a photographer to promote our local gigs and as luck
                        would have it Robbie came in last minute and did an amazing job. Since then I haven't used any
                        other photographer. Great work and a great guy!. A pleaseure to work with." John C. Richards,
